SCRIPT A – Aggregate Raw Daily Data by Age Group and Vaccination Status

This script replaces the need for SQLite-based aggregation by directly processing the raw data into daily summaries, making it faster and easier to use.

Main Functions:

    Loads and cleans about 11 million individual-level records of deaths and vaccination Dates from Vesely_106_202403141131.csv
    Download: https://github.com/PalackyUniversity/uzis-data-analysis/blob/main/data/Vesely_106_202403141131.tar.xz

    Calculates each person’s age at AGE_REFERENCE_DATE 01.01.2023, (Sart of Observation is START_DATE 01.01.2020).

    Determines whether each person was vaccinated or unvaccinated at the time of death.

    Generates the following daily tables as csv file (rows = days 0-1532, columns = ages 0–113):

        Total deaths

        Deaths among vaccinated individuals

        Deaths among unvaccinated individuals

        Total population per age group (static over time)

        Daily count of newly vaccinated individuals (first dose)

        Daily decrease in unvaccinated individuals (equal to daily new vaccinated, with negative sign)

        Total administered doses and first doses (daily counts)

Script location: C:\github\CzechFOI-DRATE\Py Scripts\A) generate aggregated csv files from CzechFOI.py
All output tables are saved as CSV files to folder C:\github\CzechFOI-DRATE\TERRA\ for easy visualization or further analysis
