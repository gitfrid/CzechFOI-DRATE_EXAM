## Investigation of the Non-Random Boundary Condition Bias

The **non-random boundary condition bias** arises when a homogeneous group is **divided into subgroups based on a non-random time point**—as often happens in real observational studies—and these subgroups are then compared.

This can lead to **illusory differences between groups**, even when **no real causal effect** exists.

Unlike more widely recognized biases such as:

- Immortal time bias  
- Healthy user bias  
- Selection bias  
- Treatment delay bias  

...this bias is often **overlooked**, yet it can have a **major impact** on the interpretation of observational data.
